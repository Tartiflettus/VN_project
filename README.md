# VN_project
A VN project. Mostly for fun
The scenario format is a text file, that allows anyone to edit it as he wants.
Because our lives are difficult, a scenario editor will be available.

Current bugs and todos:
- Compiles without problem on windows platform, but doesn't work at all. A use of gdb tells us that the program is starting, but no other messages are displayed.
- todo : background loader
- current work : the editor. Continue on text, then music, voice, background and character.
